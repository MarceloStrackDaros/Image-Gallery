## Image-Gallery

An image gallery that allows the user to change the images on the screen upon clicking the arrows to view all images.

## Future Implementations
Currently it is not possible to view the uploaded images (the images are uploaded in the application but only the current image being displayed in the page can ve viewed). A future implementation will include all images in the bottom of the page, the main image will be displayed as it currently is but will also be highlighted in this small view, and the other images will be displayed side by side in a small size.
